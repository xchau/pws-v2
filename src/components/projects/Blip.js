            When it was time to decide on a capstone project idea, I had two equally appealing candidates: 1) a visual web app that broke down spending from various charities, or 2) visual travel diary/cookbook. The decision didn't prove too difficult as

            (the premier resource on charity data) sent me this in response to an API key request:
